   --  In order for unit names to be resolved the sources of project tree
   --  need to be computed, so GPR2.Tree.Update_Sources needs to be called
   --  before creating a unit provider. In addition, in order to resolve
   --  runtime unit names corresponding project tree sources need to be updated
   --  with runtime files included: With_Runtime parameter of Update_Sources
   --  needs to be set to True. Source recomputation is a costly operation and
   --  unit provider does not enforce it to avoid unnecessary recomputation.
